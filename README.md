# README for Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data
#### David Neary

## Analysis
Provided are the files and script to run an analysis on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. To run the script please make sure your working directory is in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder. Also keep in mind that the completed analysis creates two files in that folder. R must be installed on the computer running the analysis for program to work.

## Files
- 'README.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R': Script to complete required analysis for project

- 'CodeBook.md': Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations

- 'UCI HAR Dataset': Folder which contains the datasets used (see below)

#### The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
